# Linear-Regression
Introduction

This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict the relationship between sales and advertising. The model is built using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. The project demonstrates fundamental steps in machine learning, including data exploration, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains two variables:

Sales: The dependent variable representing the sales volume.

Advertising: The independent variable representing the amount spent on advertising.

Project Structure

The project follows these steps:

Data Loading and Exploration: Load the dataset and analyze its structure.

Data Visualization: Plot scatter plots to examine the relationship between sales and advertising.

Data Preprocessing: Reshape and split the data into training and testing sets.

Model Training: Train a linear regression model using Scikit-learn.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using RMSE and R² score.

Results Visualization: Plot the regression line and residual errors to understand model performance.

Requirements

The following Python libraries are required:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

scikit-learn

Install the requirements using pip:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

Usage

To run the project, open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells step by step. The notebook demonstrates the entire process, from loading data to visualizing the results.

Results

The model predicts the relationship between sales and advertising, providing the slope and intercept of the regression line. Additionally, it evaluates the model with metrics like RMSE and R² score.

Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the use of linear regression to analyze and predict relationships between variables. It provides a practical understanding of regression techniques and model evaluation in machine learning.
